# Main keys

- **Dynamic Data Management:** Demonstrates generic CRUD operations using reflection and annotations, allowing for operations on department and employee data without tight coupling to class structures.
- **Runtime Type Inspection:** Utilizes Java Reflection API for inspecting and manipulating classes and objects at runtime, adapting behavior dynamically based on object metadata.
- **Custom Annotation Processing:** Shows how custom annotations can automate code generation or configuration tasks, streamlining development processes and reducing errors.
- **Error Handling and Dynamic Proxies:** Introduces advanced error management techniques and the use of dynamic proxies for method interception, facilitating sophisticated operation handling like automatic transaction management.
  
  The project leverages Java Reflection API, annotations, dynamic proxies, and potentially aspects of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to demonstrate metaprogramming's power in creating adaptable, maintainable software
